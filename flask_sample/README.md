# Web Systems Development Project

Hey there! I'm Denil Jain, and this is my Web Systems Development project created as part of the course.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a platform for managing movies, allowing users to interact with movie listings and administrators to oversee and control movie-related functionalities.

### Movies Route

- **Admin Capabilities:**
  - **Add/Edit/Delete Movies:** Administrators can add, edit, or delete movie entries, including details like title, release date, and image URL.
  - **View Associations:** Admins can visualize and manage associations between movies and users, controlling which movies are associated with each user.

- **User Capabilities:**
  - **View Movies:** Users can browse through a list of movies available in the system.
  - **Watch Later List:** Users can create a "Watch Later" list by associating movies they want to watch.

This page acts as a central hub for managing movies, giving administrators control over movie entries and allowing users to interact with available movie listings.


## Milestones

I've structured the project into three milestones, each focusing on specific aspects:

- [Milestone 2](https://github.com/denilayush/dj325-is601-007/blob/prod/flask_sample/Milestone2-submission.md)
- [Milestone 3](https://github.com/denilayush/dj325-is601-007/blob/prod/flask_sample/milestone3.md)
